collaboration:
  - name: Itay Yarom
    comment: >- 
      I was sitting next to Itay in the comp labs. I was thinking about how I could reduce the complexity of
      all valid moves by considering rotations as the same in terms of placement rules. Itay suggested that this
      could be extended to Piece placement. I implemented all the changes myself and I inititated the discussion as to 
      how I could start considering some moves as identical in placement validity.
